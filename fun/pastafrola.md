# Pastfrola 

Pasta frola is a type of sweet tart common in Argentina. It is a quince-jam-filled shortcrust pastry most usually oven-baked in a circular shape. The covering of the tart is a thin-striped lattice which displays the filling beneath in square sections.

## Ingredients 

### for the dough 

1. 100 g margarine 
2. 260 g sugar 
3. 160 g banana 
4. 50 g sunflower oil 
5. 1 teaspoon vanilla sugar 
6. 1 teaspoon salt 
7. 630 g flour 
8. 4 teaspoon baking powder 
9. 40 ml water 

### for the filling 

About 750 g quince cheese (a sweet, thick jelly made of the pulp of the quince fruit) or equivalent amount of cooked, mushed and sweetened quince fruits. 

## Preparation 

Add ingredients for the dough in the order of listing. Add only enough water to make the dough kneadable. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes. 

In the meantime heat the quince chese over low heat, stirring frequently until mixture has melted enough to be smooth and have a spreadable consistency. Add a little water if necessary. Remove from heat. 

Use three quarters of the dough to line the bottom and sides of the tart pan. Spread the filling evenly over the dough. 

Roll out the remaining dough on a floured surface, and cut into thin strips of dough, using them to make a lattice pattern over the top of the tart.

Bake until golden brown (about 30 to 45 minutes). 

Sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired, or brush with an apricot glaze.
